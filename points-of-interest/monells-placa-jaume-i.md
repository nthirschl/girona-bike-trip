## About
Plaça Jaume I is the arcaded main square of Monells, a beautifully preserved medieval village in the Baix Empordà region. The square dates back to the 17th century when it was one of the most important grain and livestock markets in Catalonia.

Stone houses with porticoed arches surround the square, with terraces for drinks and strolling under vine-covered porches. Monells sits at the edge of the Gavarres Natural Park, very close to the Costa Brava.
